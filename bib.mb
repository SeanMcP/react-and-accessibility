React && Accessibility

Since its creation at Facebook in 2013, React has grown to become the most popular modern front-end framework (Krotoff, 2019). A large ecosystem of libraries has grown around React, making it a powerful choice for creating dynamic web applications in 2019.

In those six years, React has developed a reputation (particularly on Twitter) for generation inaccessible web applications (silentworks 2018, renestalder 2018, p1u30 2019). Part of the criticism is deserved; you need not look any further than Twitter itself to find a React application with accessibility issues.
