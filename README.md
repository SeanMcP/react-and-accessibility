# React && Accessibility

**Objective**: Learn the importance of accessible development and some key strategies for making React applications accessible.

**Title**: React && Accessibility - Creating accessible React applications for everyone

**Abstract**: React has developed a reputation for generating inaccessible web applications. We'll dive into the world of accessibility and dispel that myth while learning some practical examples and helpful tools for creating accessible React applications.

**Description**: The goal of this session is to learn the importance of accessible development and some key strategies for making React applications accessible. We'll define accessibility and explore the ethical and legal motivation for creating accessible applications. Digging into the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), we'll look into using some basic techniques to make React applications more perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Finally, we'll look at some of the tooling and resources available to help developers create more accessible applications.
